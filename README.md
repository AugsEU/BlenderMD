# BlenderMD
Little plugin that exports an fbx then converts it to bmd using superbmd.

When you download this you have to edit the line

          default="C:\\Users\\August\\Downloads\\Sunshine ROM hacking\\SuperBMD\\", #bad!!! must find better way
To your own path of where superBMD.exe is. Maybe I will find a better way of doing this in future. Make sure to use double back-slash to escape the characters.
